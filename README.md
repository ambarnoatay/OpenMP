# OpenMP
To understand and apply the principles of OpenMP for parallel calculations in a computationally-intensive problem related to the Electric Field calculations.
Create an application that uses OpenMP for multithreading to calculate the electric field at a point in space.

The program should queries the user for how many threads to run concurrently when doing the calculation.

Query the user for the size of the N x M array and the charge q.

Continuously prompt the user if a new calculation is wanted.

Use OpenMP to reduce the processing time taken.
